0. Fix image transparency (maybe try player image first)

1. Give player images
2. Give enemies image
2. Animate player and enemy images
3. Make function for sorting all Living Objects in order of their 'feet' in the Y axis 
	e.g. lower down it is, more in front it is
	a. (Bullets maybe sort in order of Y axis from WHERE THEY ARE SHOT and then keep that static)
		i. if shooting up it should be infront
		ii.if shooting down it should be behind

5. Create another gun subclass
6. Give enemy chance of dropping a random gun
7. Create method in player for assigning a different gun

9. Give enemies attack method
10.Create multiple enemy subclasses

11. Write code for displaying living objects health
12. Either health bar or text above the enemy

13. Write code for writing text of bullets damage after it hits an enemy

17. Restructure so each time a bullet is created it is passed in its speed, damage, and max distance
18. Have guns constructor randomise its damage, time between shots, etc. within a range
19. then instantiate bullets using those parameters so each gun is slightly different


20. Once this is done, your framework for your game is done!
21. Work on meeting compulsory CW4 requirements and then decide on which Optional CW4 requirements to work on
